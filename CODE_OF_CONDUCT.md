# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## The Don't Be A Douche Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. In short, this a place to foster learning and not to troll or be a douche. 

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language and not words that will anger or put down others.
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences, to put into context, encourage growth but fostering innovation and good ideas. 
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism is a method for growth and learning. Every failure is a lesson for improvement and future success.
* Focusing on what is best for the community, if a new version is available, share it, update what is depricated or no longer relevant.
* Showing empathy towards other community members is a common courtesy and builds stronger communities.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances will have you banned for life. 
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks will have you banned for life.
* Public or private harassment will have you reported to the local authorites if it is warranted and guess what? Have you banned for life.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission will do the same as above.
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting will have you banned for life.

## Our Responsibilities

I am the sole project maintainer and am responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. An email will be sent to me and I will decide if you've crossed the line and if warranted, will bann you for life.

As the project maintainer, I have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at david.f.evans@gmail.com. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
